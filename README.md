# Amazon-Tracking
An Amazon price tracker for a particular product.

The functionality of the project is as follows:
1. Add an product URL(from amazon.in, flipkart etc) to track.
2. Add an threshold value or track on price changes.
3. If threshold value is added then, when the price of the product is below the threshold value given then a mail will be triggered.
4. If tracking is done on every price change then according to price updates the mail will be triggered.
5. The record of the price history will be stored which can be refereed by the user.

Kindly refer to the requirement.txt file for the dependencies.

Kindly note this project uses GOOGLE APIs. All the email and storage quota is subjected to GOOGLE'S policies.
